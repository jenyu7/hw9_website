## Interactive Figures from Analysis. 
Below, we included the graphs obtained from our analysis. The first three graphs are from our exploratory analysis. We have an ECDF of the times to catastrophe for each concentration of tubulin. Additionally, we have two strip-box plots, one with jitter and the other without. They give us an idea of the sparsity of data points for times in the 14 uM data compared to the other concentrations. 

Our last two graphs are those of the confidence intervals of beta and alpha parameters with respect to concentration.
