  Comparing two models for Microtubule Catastrophe

Abstract: >
  To accomplish various functions in cells, microtubules are dynamic and remodel at the ends of individual microtubules. A catastrophe event is marked by a sudden switch of a growing microtubule into a shortening state. Here we isolate labeled tubulin data to compare two models for microtubule catastrophe. The two models we discuss are the Gamma distribution and a bespoke distribution given by the arrival of two Poisson processes in sequence, with potentially different rate parameters. By generating maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the parameters of each model, we determine Akaike information criterion to then compare the models. Based on computed Akaike weights, we find that the Gamma distribution is a better model for the generative distribution for time to catastrophe in microtubules. Finally, we use the Gamma distribution and calculate MLEs for the parameters for each tubulin concentration to visualize any differences across concentrations; we find no clear trend in the model parameters across tubulin concentrations. 

Summary:  >
  In the [Gardner, Zanic, et al paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037), the authors compared measurements of microtubule catastrophe times for experiments using fluorescently labeled tubulin and unlabeled tubulin.

  We use this dataset to evaluate our models for microtubule catastrophe. Since it was shown that there is no discernable difference in catastrophe times between labeled and unlabeled tubulin, we exclusively use labeled tubulin data in this analysis. 
  
  We observed that microtubule catastrophe is modelled better under a Gamma distribution compared to a bespoke distribution given by the arrival of two Poisson processes in sequence.
